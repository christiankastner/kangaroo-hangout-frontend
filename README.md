# Kangaroo-Hangout-Frontend

Flatiron School Module 4 Project Frontend by [Christian Kastner](https://github.com/ckastner12)

Krazy Poems is a program designed to liven up poems or text by identifying nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs in a sentence and replacing them with other random words. You can also have your new krazy poem read aloud by a diverse set of different voices and even add music to the reading!

## Installation

After you've followed the [backend instructions](https://github.com/mattgahrns/noun-swapper-backend)

cd into the proper frontend directory and install the node packages

```bash
npm i
```

Next you load up the frontend server with:

```bash
npm start
```

The call should load up the app, and running the front and backends simultaneously will give you full access.

Enjoy your next hangout!
